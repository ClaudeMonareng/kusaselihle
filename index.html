            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p>We hold a strong belief that a child's growth and development into adulthood is moulded and grounded in the foundation phase. Children enter the public schooling system ill-prepared, un-assessed of their true abilities and potential and lacking in foundational grounding, that is provided by creches and pre-schools. In solving these social-educational ills, Kusaselihle was founded.</p>
            <p class="founding">Our founding pillars include but are not limited to the following:</p>
            <p class="list">To reduce child poverty in the rural community by ensuring that children receive at least two daily meals, in partnership with local stakeholders</p>
            <p class="list">To assist young mothers be able to continue and further their education. </p>
            <p class="list">To assist hardworking single parents achieve an important work-life balance</p>
            <p class="list">To assess and prepare our children to be physically and psychologically fit for the public schooling system</p>

                <span>Chairperson <br> Nutrition and Catering</span>
                <p>I love and enjoy sewing, gardening and spending quality with my family, in my spare time. My background in ECD was grounded and inspired by a D.G Murray funded learneship. It was an ECD centered learnership focused on Orientation and Basics, and Themes.  I hold a Level 4 NQF ECD qualification. My experience in ECD spans from teaching at Sakhisizwe creche and pre-school and Ehlanolwazi Primary School, from 2006 to 2009. I gravitated towards ECD, because I hold a firm believe that Foundational phase is a critical phase in a child's growth and development that later affects how they grow as adults. Today, im responsible with Nutrition and Catering at the creche./p>

                <p>I like to spend my spare time reading books and socialising on social media. I hold qualifications in ECD with NQF level 4 and computer studies. I am registered in UNISA for Bachelor of Education in Accounting. I started teaching ECD in 2013, in Kusaselihle. My passion in teaching ECD came as an inspiration from my dear mother, who is also an ECD practitioner. I love children and I enjoy myself when i spend my time with them.</p>

                <p>When im not dedicating my time at the creche, i enjoy doing gardening and chores at home. My background in ECD was inspired by the Feed the Babies education program in 2023. The program introduced me to Orientation and Themes. As of 2024 it introduced Lego Box. I love chidren and would like to describe myself as a very patient person with them. Im responsible with Personal Hygiene and Care. I started working in Kusaselihle in 2022.</p>

                <p>I enjoy being in the company of children and reading them stories and bible verses. I also like doing chores, when im at home. I love to impart to knowledge on chidren for their growth and well-being. I love teaching little children, it is something that was naturally instilled in me and very much a part of my being. I used to volunteer in eSakhisizwe creche and pre-school in 2008. In 2020 I started to teach in Kusaselihle. In 2023 I started to do a learnership with Feeders Babies Fund. It included areas, such as Orientation, Creche Management and Themes and now I am currently doing ECD NQF level 4.</p>
